# Horiseon - Code Refactor

This project was to refactor the code of an existing webpage given to me to make it accessible.

## Introduction

To leave the code cleaner than I found it and add HTML elements so that the site is optimized for search engines.

## Updates made to Existing Code

I added line comments to describe each area of the existing code.
Also formatted the document to have the correct indentation and spaces, as well as, made Search Engine Optimization link funtional. I then added alt attributes to the images and added a title to the webpage.

HTML semantic elements used:
* Header
* Nav
* Figure
* Main
* Section
* Article
* Aside
* Footer

## Updates made to existing CSS

I added line comments to describe the sections. I also cleaned up CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements and consolidated CSS selectors and properties.
